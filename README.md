### Why Algorithms?

<details>
  <summary>
    Efficient problem solving. <i>(Click to expand)</i>
  </summary>

### Efficient problem solving

- Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve problems 
- One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms
- Every algorithm comes with its own trade-offs when it comes to performance
